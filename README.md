# Loan-Default-Prediction
The goal was to build a ML model to predict the credit worthiness of a client for sanction of a Home Equity Loan. Data has been obtained via the existing loan underwriting process from recent applicants who have been given credit. With predictive modeling, task was to implement ECOA's guidelines, reduce the losses associated with HMEQ loans for lenders, simplify the decision making process by getting rid of biases/HEs and provide a justification for any adverse behavior (rejections).

Skills and Tools

Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Bagging, Similarity Based Recommendation System

Conclusion

The project proposes the use of Tuned Decision Tree model for prediction of credit worthiness of a client to sanction Home Equity Loan &amp; to determine key features driving loan defaults. A conservative approach is followed to minimize the risk of default, i.e. the bank should not lend to clients with higher probability of default. It boasts a good recall on the data, is highly interpretable &amp; helps establish the implementation of ECOA guidelines by explaining the factors behind loan application rejection.
